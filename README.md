## Abstract
The prediction of stock prices is an important task in economics, investment and financial decision-making. This has for decades, spurred the interest of many researchers through their focused research in designing stock price predictive models. In this paper, the symbiotic organisms search algorithm, a new metaheuristic algorithm is employed as an efficient method for training feedforward neural networks. The training process is used to build a better stock price predictive model. The Straits Times Index, Russell 2,000, NASDAQ Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices are utilized as time series dataset for training and testing the new system. Three evaluation methods namely, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Deviation are used to compare the results of the implemented model. The results obtained revealed that the hybrid model exhibited outstanding predictive performance compared to the hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average based models. The new model is a promising predictive technique for solving high dimensional nonlinear time series data that are difficult to capture by traditional models.
